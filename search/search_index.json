We believe that adding smart interactions and adaptive audio filters alone will already expand our user base by 15%. With the new generation AirPods we aim to match at least the sound quality of our main competitor, the Sony WF-1000XM3, and include Active Noise Canceling that is also featured in Mifo, House of Marley, Bose, and Amazon Echo products.
